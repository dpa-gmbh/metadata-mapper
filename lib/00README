** This directory is for *exceptional* cases only! **


Please always use maven dependencies. Here we only place 
jars for which no maven artifact exists. In this case this
is a special version of apache commons imaging. This
version includes a patch which allows us to use encodings
different from 8859-1 in IIM fields. The official apache 
version always uses 8895-1 encoding.
